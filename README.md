# panir
<b>Panir</b> was our project with vegetarian recipes in Russian. 

Unfortunately, we closed this project. However, we'd like to save it (at least in a static state) because we like recipes from there, and sometimes we cook using them. 

So you can download the repository and open the file <i>index.html</i> in your browser, then you can use it like a usual site.
